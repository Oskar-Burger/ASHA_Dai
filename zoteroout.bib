The performance of ASHA is, therefore, critical for the success of NRHM and hence of the health improvement strategy of the government of India. Objectives: (1) To evaluate the knowledge and performance of ASHA. (2) To assess the factors affecting these two attributes of ASHA. Methods: Ten ASHAs were randomly selected from each of the eight administrative blocks of Anand District. Thus, a total of 80 ASHAs participated in the study. Knowledge of ASHAs was assessed by computing knowledge score which included 15 questions, while the performance was assessed through performance score which included 17 indicators. Each ASHA was ranked "Poor," "Average," and "Good" based on the performance score. Results: Out of 80 ASHAs, 49 (61\%) were in the age group of 30-40 years. Majority of ASHAs(68\%) belonged to other backward class (OBC). 73 (91\%) ASHAs had education up to at least secondary level. 65 (81\%) ASHAs were working for more than 4 years. About 84\% of ASHAs had knowledge score between 12 and 15. Nearly 51\% of ASHAs ranked average in performance, while 49\% ranked poor. None of the ASHAs ranked good. Knowledge score and performance ranks were not associated with age, caste, education, and duration of service of ASHAs. Performance ranks were found to be significantly associated only with time lapse since the last training received. Conclusion: To strengthen the grass root cader of ASHAs, their evaluation should be conducted regularly. Additional refresher training should be provided to ASHAs with low knowledge and performance scores so that the engagement of rural community with the health system can be improved.},

  abstract = {Introduction Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), affects 213 countries or territories globally. We received a request from National Health Systems Resource Centre, a public agency in India, to conduct rapid evidence synthesis (RES) on community health workers (CHWs) for COVID-19 prevention and control in 3 days. Methods We searched PubMed, websites of ministries (n=3), public agencies (n=6), multilateral institutions (n=3), COVID-19 resource aggregators (n=5) and preprints (n=1) (without language restrictions) for articles on CHWs in pandemics. Two reviewers screened the records independently with a third reviewer resolving disagreements. One reviewer extracted data with another reviewer cross-checking it. A framework on CHW performance in primary healthcare not specific to pandemic was used to guide data extraction and narrative analysis. Results We retrieved 211 records and finally included 36 articles. Most of the evidence was from low-and middle-income countries with well-established CHW programmes. Evidence from CHW programmes initiated during pandemics and for CHW involvement in pandemic response in high-income countries was scant. CHW roles and tasks change substantially during pandemics. Clear guidance, training for changed roles and definition of what constitutes essential activities (ie, those that must to be sustained) is required. Most common additional activities during pandemics were community awareness, engagement and sensitisation (including for countering stigma) and contact tracing. CHWs were reported to be involved in all aspects of contact tracing - this was reported to affect routine service delivery. CHWs have often been stigmatised or been socially ostracised during pandemics. Providing PPE, housing allowance, equal training opportunities, transportation allowance, improving salaries (paid on time and for a broad range of services) and awards in high-profile public events contributed to better recruitment and retention. We also created inventories of resources with guiding notes on guidelines for health workers (n=24), self-isolation in the community (n=10) and information, education and counselling materials on COVID-19 (n=16). Conclusions CHWs play a critical role in pandemics. It is important to ensure role clarity, training, supportive supervision, as well as their work satisfaction, health and well-being. More implementation research on CHWs in pandemics is required.},

  abstract = {Objective This pilot study investigated the feasibility of delivering a package of community-based interventions for improving perinatal care using lady health workers (LHWs) and traditional birth attendants (Dais) in rural Pakistan. Methods The intervention was implemented in four of eight village clusters (315 villages, total population 138 600), while four served as a comparison group. The LHWs in intervention clusters received additional training focused on essential maternal and newborn care, conducted community education group sessions, and were encouraged to link up with local Dais. The intervention was delivered within the regular government LHW programme and was supported by the creation of voluntary community health committees. Findings In intervention villages, there were significant reductions from baseline in stillbirth (from 65.9 to 43.1 per 1000 births, P {$<$} 0.001) and neonatal mortality rates (from 57.3 to 41.3 per 1000 live births, P {$<$} 0.001). The proportion of deliveries conducted by skilled attendants at public sector facilities also increased, from 18\% at baseline to 30\%, while the proportion of home births decreased from 79\% to 65\%. A household survey indicated a higher frequency of key behaviours (e.g. early and exclusive breastfeeding, delayed bathing and cord care) in intervention villages. Conclusion The improved stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates observed indicate that community health workers (i.e. LHWs and Dais ) can be effective in implementing a community and outreach package that leads to improved home care practices by families, increased care-seeking behaviour and greater utilization of skilled care providers. These preliminary observations require confirmation in an adequately powered trial.},

These methods allow the data-based selection of a ``best'' model and a ranking and weighting of the remaining models in a pre-de?ned set. Traditional statistical inference can then be based on this selected best model. However, we now emphasize that information-theoretic approaches allow formal inference to be based on more than one model (m- timodel inference). Such procedures lead to more robust inferences in many cases, and we advocate these approaches throughout the book. The second edition was prepared with three goals in mind. First, we have tried to improve the presentation of the material. Boxes now highlight ess- tial expressions and points. Some reorganization has been done to improve the ?ow of concepts, and a new chapter has been added. Chapters 2 and 4 have been streamlined in view of the detailed theory provided in Chapter 7. S- ond, concepts related to making formal inferences from more than one model (multimodel inference) have been emphasized throughout the book, but p- ticularly in Chapters 4, 5, and 6. Third, new technical material has been added to Chapters 5 and 6. Well over 100 new references to the technical literature are given. These changes result primarily from our experiences while giving several seminars, workshops, and graduate courses on material in the ?rst e- tion.},

We reviewed the results of formative research studies from 11 countries so as to understand the planned, motivated and habitual factors involved in HWWS. On average, only 17\% of child caretakers HWWS after the toilet. Handwash 'habits' were generally not inculcated at an early age. Key 'motivations' for handwashing were disgust, nurture, comfort and affiliation. Fear of disease generally did not motivate handwashing, except transiently in the case of epidemics such as cholera. 'Plans' involving handwashing included to improve family health and to teach children good manners. Environmental barriers were few as soap was available in almost every household, as was water. Because much handwashing is habitual, self-report of the factors determining it is unreliable. Candidate strategies for promoting HWWS include creating social norms, highlighting disgust of dirty hands and teaching children HWWS as good manners. Dividing the factors that determine health-related behaviour into planned, motivated and habitual categories provides a simple, but comprehensive conceptual model. The habitual aspects of many health-relevant behaviours require further study.},

  abstract = {Background: Undernutrition contributes to one-third of under-5 child mortality globally. Progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goal of reducing under-5 mortality is lagging in many countries, particularly in Africa. This paper shares evidence and insights from a low-cost behavior-change innovation in a rural area of Mozambique. Intervention: About 50,000 households with pregnant women or children under 2 years old were organized into blocks of 12 households. One volunteer peer educator (Care Group Volunteer, or CGV) was selected for each block. Approximately 12 CGVs met together as a group every 2 weeks with a paid project promoter to learn a new child-survival health or nutrition message or skill. Then the CGVs shared the new message with mothers in their assigned blocks. Methods of evaluation: Household surveys were conducted at baseline and endline to measure nutrition-related behaviors and childhood nutritional status. Findings: More than 90\% of beneficiary mothers reported that they had been contacted by CGVs during the previous 2 weeks. In the early implementation project area, the percentage of children 0\textendash 23 months old with global undernutrition (weight-for-age with z-score of less than 2 standard deviations below the international standard mean) declined by 8.1 percentage points (P{$<$}0.001), from 25.9\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 22.2\%\textendash 29.6\%) at baseline to 17.8\% at endline (95\% CI = 14.6\%\textendash 20.9\%). In the delayed implementation area, global undernutrition declined by 11.5 percentage points (P{$<$}0.001), from 27.1\% (95\% CI = 23.6\%\textendash 30.6\%) to 15.6\% (95\% CI = 12.6\%\textendash 18.6\%). Total project costs were US\$3.0 million, representing an average cost of US\$0.55 per capita per year (among the entire population of 1.1 million people) and US\$2.78 per beneficiary (mothers with young children) per year. Conclusion: Using the Care Group model can improve the level of global undernutrition in children at scale and at low cost. This model shows sufficient promise to merit further rigorous testing and broader application.},

This review was conducted using 2015 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Six computerized bibliographic databases, Scopus, PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase, and Ovid MEDLINE, were searched for published studies on factors associated with IYCF practices in India from 1 January 1993, to 30 April 2020. IYCF practices examined were early initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding, continued breastfeeding at one year, introduction to solid semi-solid or soft foods, minimum dietary diversity, minimum meal frequency, minimum acceptable diet, continued breastfeeding at two years, predominant breastfeeding, and bottle feeding. In total, 6968 articles were retrieved, and 46 studies met the inclusion criteria. The common enablers of IYCF were higher maternal socioeconomic status (SES) and more frequent antenatal care visits (ANC) ({$\geq$}3). Common barriers to IYCF practices were low SES and less frequent ANC. The review showed that the factors associated with IYCF practices in India are largely modifiable and multi-factorial. Improving IYCF practices would require the adoption of both facilities- and community-based policy interventions at the subnational and national levels in India.},

  abstract = {Do firstborn children have a height advantage? Empirical findings have found mostly that, yes, second or higher-order children often lag behind firstborns in height outcomes, especially in developing countries. However, empirical investigations of birth-order effects on child height overlook the potential impact that birth spacing can have. We provide an explanation for the negative birth-order effect on stunting outcomes for young Indian children and show it is driven by short preceding-birth spacing. We find that firstborn children are taller than children of higher birth order: The height-for-age gap for third (or higher)-order children is twice the gap for children second in birth order. However, this pattern is observed when spacing between later-born children and their immediate elder siblings is fewer than 3 y. Interestingly, the firstborn height advantage disappears when later-born children are born at least 3 y after their elder siblings. Thus, our findings indicate that spacing length between children explains differences in height, over birth order. Although India's family planning policy has resulted in a substantial reduction in total fertility, its achievement in spacing subsequent births has been less impressive. In showing that spacing can alleviate or aggravate birth-order effects on attained height, our study fills an evidence gap: Reducing fertility alone may not be sufficient in overcoming negative birth-order effects. To reduce the detrimental effects of birth order on child stunting, policy responses\textemdash and therefore research priorities\textemdash require a stronger focus on increasing the time period between births.},

Yet designing behavior change interventions is often an unsystematic process, hobbled by insufficient understanding of contextual and perceptual behavioral drivers and a narrow focus on limited research methods to assess them. We propose a toolkit (CUBES) of two solutions to help programs arrive at more effective interventions. First, we introduce a novel framework of behavior, which is a practical tool for programs to structure potential drivers and match corresponding interventions. This evidence-based framework was developed through extensive cross-sectoral literature research and refined through application in large-scale global development programs. Second, we propose a set of descriptive, experimental, and simulation approaches that can enhance and expand the methods commonly used in global development. Since not all methods are equally suited to capture the different types of drivers of behavior, we present a decision aid for method selection. We recommend that existing commonly used methods, such as observations and surveys, use CUBES as a scaffold and incorporate validated measures of specific types of drivers in order to comprehensively test all the potential components of a target behavior. We also recommend under-used methods from sectors such as market research, experimental psychology, and decision science, which programs can use to extend their toolkit and test the importance and impact of key enablers and barriers. The CUBES toolkit enables programs across sectors to streamline the process of conceptualizing, designing, and optimizing interventions, and ultimately to change behaviors and achieve targeted outcomes.},

Design Cross-sectional study employing mixed-methods approach involved survey and focus group discussions. Setting The state of Orissa. Participants 386 CHWs representing 10\% of the total CHWs in the chosen districts and from settings selected through a multi-stage stratified sampling. Primary and secondary outcome measures The level of performance motivation among the CHWs, its determinants and their current status as per the perceptions of the CHWs. Results The level of performance motivation was the highest for the individual and the community level factors (mean score 5.94\textendash 4.06), while the health system factors scored the least (2.70\textendash 3.279). Those ASHAs who felt having more community and system-level recognition also had higher levels of earning as CHWs (p=0.040, 95\% CI 0.06 to 0.12), a sense of social responsibility (p=0.0005, 95\% CI 0.12 to 0.25) and a feeling of self-efficacy (p=0.000, 95\% CI 0.38 to 0.54) on their responsibilities. There was no association established between their level of dissatisfaction on the incentives (p=0.385) and the extent of motivation. The inadequate healthcare delivery status and certain working modalities reduced their motivation. Gender mainstreaming in the community health approach, especially on the demand-side and community participation were the positive externalities of the CHW programme. Conclusions The CHW programme could motivate and empower local lay women on community health largely. The desire to gain social recognition, a sense of social responsibility and self-efficacy motivated them to perform. The healthcare delivery system improvements might further motivate and enable them to gain the community trust. The CHW management needs amendments to ensure adequate supportive supervision, skill and knowledge enhancement and enabling working modalities.},

  abstract = {Primates are characterized by relatively late ages at first reproduction, long lives and low fertility. Together, these traits define a life-history of reduced reproductive effort. Understanding the optimal allocation of reproductive effort, and specifically reduced reproductive effort, has been one of the key problems motivating the development of life-history theory. Because of their unusual constellation of life-history traits, primates play an important role in the continued development of life-history theory. In this review, I present the evidence for the reduced reproductive effort life histories of primates and discuss the ways that such life-history tactics are understood in contemporary theory. Such tactics are particularly consistent with the predictions of stochastic demographic models, suggesting a key role for environmental variability in the evolution of primate life histories. The tendency for~primates to specialize in high-quality, high-variability food items may make them particularly susceptible to environmental variability and explains their~low reproductive-effort tactics. I discuss recent applications of life-history theory to human evolution and emphasize the continuity between models used to explain peculiarities of human reproduction and senescence with the long, slow life histories of primates more generally.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Habit formation has been proposed as a means to promote maintenance of healthy behaviours, but there have been few investigations into how habits are formed. This exploratory study sought to model determinants of the formation of a dental flossing habit, including placement of the behaviour within the routine (before vs. after tooth-brushing), past behaviour, prospective memory ability, and motivational factors. DESIGN AND METHOD: All participants (N = 50) received a motivational intervention designed to initiate behaviour change and habit formation. Half of the participants were instructed to floss before brushing, and half after. Participants subsequently self-reported flossing behaviour daily and, 4 weeks later, flossing automaticity. Automaticity and flossing frequency were also measured at 8-month follow-up. RESULTS: Participants with stronger prospective memory ability, higher levels of past behaviour, and a more positive attitude flossed more frequently during the study. Stronger automaticity was predicted by positive attitudes, and increased behaviour frequency during and prior to the study. Those who flossed after brushing (rather than before) tended to form stronger flossing habits and, at 8-month follow-up, had stronger habits and flossed more frequently. CONCLUSIONS: Habit forming interventions might usefully consider features of everyday routines and how behaviour may be reinforced. Suggestions for further research using more methodologically rigorous designs are offered. STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION: What is already known on this subject? The formation of habit - that is, a learnt automatic response to contextual cues - requires initiation of a behaviour and repetition in a constant context. A recent formation study showed variation in habit strength despite equal repetitions, indicating that factors other than repetition may be important in habit development. From studies of routine behaviour, the boundaries between sub-routines are characterized by different processes than the middle of sub-routines, suggesting that placement of behaviour within existing routines may affect the likelihood of habit formation. What does this study add? Greater prospective memory ability predicted more frequent dental flossing. Initiating flossing after rather than before tooth-brushing promoted stronger habits. Positive attitudes impacted directly on habit formation, independent of behaviour repetition.},

  abstract = {One of the striking features of human social complexity is that we provide care to sick and contagious individuals, rather than avoiding them. Care-giving is a powerful strategy of disease control in human populations today; however, we are not the only species which provides care for the sick. Widespread reports occurring in distantly related species like cetaceans and insects suggest that the building blocks of care for the sick are older than the human lineage itself. This raises the question of what evolutionary processes drive the evolution of such care in animals, including humans. I synthesize data from the literature to evaluate the diversity of care-giving behaviors and conclude that across the animal kingdom there appear to be two distinct types of care-behaviors, both with separate evolutionary histories: (1) social care behaviors benefitting a sick individual by promoting healing and recovery and (2) community health behaviors that control pathogens in the environment and reduce transmission within the population. By synthesizing literature from psychology, anthropology, and biology, I develop a novel hypothesis (Hominin Pathogen Control Hypothesis) to explain how these two distinct sets of behaviors evolved independently then merged in the human lineage. The hypothesis suggests that social care evolved in association with offspring care systems whereas community health behaviors evolved as a type of niche construction. These two types of behaviors merged in humans to produce complex, multi-level healthcare networks in humans. Moreover, each type of care increases selection for the other, generating feedback loops that selected for increasing healthcare behaviors over time. Interestingly, domestication processes may have contributed to both social care and community health aspects of this process.},

Methods: The cross-sectional study surveyed mothers of children aged 6\textendash 23 months. A total of 3455 mothers were selected via multistage cluster sampling. The seven health outcomes related to the community health worker (CHW) visits were: institutional delivery, complete immunization, exclusive breastfeeding for six months, timely introduction of complementary feeding, continued breastfeeding during child's illness, handwashing, and awareness of Nutrition and Health Days (NHDs). Results: The results varied by state. Mothers who received ASHA visits were significantly less likely to have an institutional delivery, timely introduction of complementary feeding, awareness of Nutrition and Health Days (NHDs), proper handwashing, and exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months in at least one of the four states. Conversely, AWW's home visits were positively predictive of the following health outcomes in certain states: complete immunization for index child, continued breastfeeding during the child's illness, handwashing, and awareness of NHDs. Conclusions: ASHAs' home visits were not more strongly associated with health outcomes for which they were paid than outcomes for which they were unpaid. AWWs' home visits were positively associated with awareness of NHDs, and associations varied for other recommended health behaviors. Further research could elucidate the causes for successes and failures of CHW programs in different states of India.},

The study was planned to assess the knowledge and practices for maternal health care delivery among Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers in North-East district of Delhi, India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in North-East district of Delhi among 55 ASHA workers after taking written informed consent. Data were collected using a pretested semi-structured questionnaire consisted of items on sociodemographic profile of ASHA workers, knowledge, and practices about maternal health. The data was analyzed by using SPSS software version 17. Qualitative data were expressed in percentages and quantitative data were expressed in mean {$\pm$} standard deviation (SD). RESULTS: Mean age ({$\pm$}SD) of ASHAs was 31.84 {$\pm$} 7.2 years. Most of the ASHAs workers were aware of their role in provision of maternal health services. Most of the ASHAs workers were aware of their work of bringing mothers for antenatal check-up (94.5\%), counseling for family planning (96.4\%), and accompanying them for hospital for delivery (89.1\%). 87\% of ASHAs knew that iron tablets have to be taken for minimum 100 days during pregnancy. 51 (92.7\%) ASHAs reported that they used to maintain antenatal register. Some problems reported by ASHAs while working in community were shortage of staff at health center (16.4\%), no transportation facility available (14.5\%), no money for emergency, and opposition from local dais (12.7\% each). CONCLUSION: Present study showed that ASHAs knowledge is good but their practices are poor due to number of problems faced by them which need to be addressed through skill based training in terms of good communication and problem solving. Monitoring should be made an integral part of ASHA working in the field to ensure that knowledge is converted into practices as well.},

The strength of CHWs' relationships with both sides influences their motivation and performance. This qualitative comparative study aimed at understanding similarities and differences in how relationships between CHWs, communities and the health sector were shaped in different Sub-Saharan African settings. The study demonstrates a complex interplay of influences on trust and CHWs' relationships with their communities and actors in the health sector. Mechanisms influencing relationships were feelings of (dis)connectedness, (un)familiarity and serving the same goals, and perceptions of received support, respect, competence, honesty, fairness and recognition. Sometimes, constrained relationships between CHWs and the health sector resulted in weaker relationships between CHWs and communities. The broader context (such as the socio-economic situation) and programme context (related to, for example, task-shifting, volunteering and supervision) in which these mechanisms took place were identified. Policy-makers and programme managers should take into account the broader context and could adjust CHW programmes so that they trigger mechanisms that generate trusting relationships between CHWs, communities and other actors in the health system. This can contribute to enabling CHWs to perform well and responding to the opportunities offered by their unique intermediary position.},

Considering their role as a link between community and health systems, frontline workers (FLWs) can be effectively utilized in strengthening maternal and newborn care. In this paper, we set out to examine the effect of intensity of contact with FLWs on key maternal and newborn health behaviors and to determine if this association varies by status of Self Help Group (SHG) membership. Methods: This population-based cross-sectional study included 2208 currently married women aged 15\textendash 49 years who had delivered a baby during the last 15 months prior to the survey and selected through a multi-stage cluster sampling from rural villages and urban wards. The outcome of interest included variables related to key knowledge and practice of healthy behavior in relation to maternal and newborn health and exposure variable considered was intensity of contact with FLWs. Results: Of the women interviewed, 1729 (78\%) belonged to SHG household. For knowledge on the need for at least 3 antenatal care (ANC) check-ups, two tetanus toxoid (TT) injections and consumption of 100 or more ironfolic acid (IFA) tablets, proportion of those who were aware of these practices increased with increasing number of contacts with FLWs (P value {$<$} 0.001). Practice for TT injections showed an increasing trend with increasing number of contacts with FLW. An increase in the odds of delivering in an institution was observed in those who had higher number of contacts as compared to those with no contacts (P value {$<$} 0.001). With regard to newborn healthy behavior practice, breastfeeding within 1 h of delivery showed significant association and the odds of this practice improved in those who had {$\geq$} 3 contacts with FLW as compared to those had no contacts. Except for consumption of 100 or more IFA tablets, there was no interaction of these associations by SHG status. Conclusion: There was an overall low prevalence of both knowledge and practice of key maternal and newborn healthy behaviors and only a few of these were associated with frequency of contacts with FLW. Findings not only highlight the urgent need for effectively leveraging FLWs to strengthen maternal and newborn care but also to improve the quality of services provided by them.},

The stressed Anganwadi and ASHA workers are likely to be unhealthy, poorly motivated, less productive, and less efficient in implementing the various national programs. Objective: The objective was to study the level of stress among the grassroot level workers and the various factors related. Materials and Methods: Study design: This was a cross-sectional study. Setting: This was conducted at PHC of Bagalkot district. Study subjects: Grassroot level workers (Anganwadi [n = 46] and ASHA [n = 29] workers) were selected. Sample size: The sample size was 75. Data collection: Date were collected through self-reporting questionnaire schedule consisting of two schedules: (i) Sociodemographic characteristics and (ii) presumptive stressful life events scale questionnaire. Scores used in the study: Fifty-one life events were found to be experienced by the normal Indian population in the past 1 year. For each life event, a mean stress score was given. The total score was obtained for each by adding all the applicable life events scores. Accordingly, they were categorized into no stress, less/moderate stress, and severe stress. Statistical test used: Analysis was performed using Chi-square test. Results: About 61.33\% were Anganwadi and 38.67\% were ASHA workers. 70.67\% had mental stress in the past 1 year. 8\% of the subjects had a family history of mental illness and 25.33\% of them were practicing yoga/meditation. 66.67\% of the study subjects had experienced severe stress and 26.67\% has mild/moderate stress. The factors such as past history of mental illness, socioeconomic status of the participants, house construction, unfulfilled commitments, unemployment of family member, loan, beginning of school, and marital conflict are significantly associated with level of stress. Conclusion and Recommendations: Psychological stress was found to be more among Anganwadi and ASHA workers.

  abstract = {Background Child health in many low- and middle-income countries lags behind international goals and affects children's education, well-being, and general development. Large-scale school health programmes can be effective in reducing preventable diseases through cost-effective interventions. This paper outlines the baseline and 1-year results of a longitudinal health study assessing the impact of the Fit for School Programme in the Philippines. Methods A longitudinal 4-year cohort study was conducted in the province of Camiguin, Mindanao (experimental group); an external concurrent control group was studied in Gingoog, Mindanao. The study has three experimental groups: group 1\textemdash daily handwashing with soap, daily brushing with fluoride toothpaste, biannual deworming with 400~mg albendazole (Essential Health Care Program [EHCP]); group 2\textemdash EHCP plus twice-a-year access to school-based Oral Urgent Treatment; group 3\textemdash EHCP plus weekly toothbrushing with high-fluoride concentration gel. A non-concurrent internal control group was also included. Baseline data on anthropometric indicators to calculate body mass index (BMI), soil-transmitted helminths (STH) infection in stool samples, and dental caries were collected in August 2009 and August 2010. Data were analysed to assess validity of the control group design, baseline, and 1-year results. Results In the cohort study, 412 children were examined at baseline and 341 1~year after intervention. The baseline results were in line with national averages for STH infection, BMI, and dental caries in group 1 and the control groups. Children lost to follow-up had similar baseline characteristics in the experimental and control groups. After 1~year, group 1 showed a significantly higher increase in mean BMI and lower prevalence of moderate to heavy STH infection than the external concurrent control group. The increases in caries and dental infections were reduced but not statistically significant. The results for groups 2 and 3 will be reported separately. Conclusions Despite the short 1-year observation period, the study found a reduction in the prevalence of moderate to heavy STH infections, a rise in mean BMI, and a (statistically non-significant) reduction in dental caries and infections. The study design proved functional in actual field conditions. Critical aspects affecting the validity of cohort studies are analysed and discussed.

  abstract = {Background\textemdash Neonatal sepsis may stem from local umbilical cord infections. Signs of cord infection are common in low-resource settings, yet the risk of mortality subsequent to these signs has not been quantified in either developed or developing countries. We compared the risk of mortality between infants with and without signs of umbilical cord infection during a communitybased trial of chlorhexidine interventions in southern Nepal. Methods\textemdash Newborns were evaluated for signs of umbilical cord infection (pus, redness, swelling). A nested case-control approach was used to estimate the odds of mortality between infants with and without umbilical cord infection as defined by various levels of severity. For each death in the parent trial, 10 controls were selected, matched on sex, treatment group, and number of cord assessments. The main outcome measures were all-cause and sepsis-specific mortality. Results\textemdash Among 23,246 assessed infants, there were 392 deaths. Odds of all-cause mortality were 46\% (8\textendash 98\%) higher among infants with redness extending onto the abdominal skin. A nonsignificant increased odds of mortality [odds ratio (OR): 2.31; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.66\textendash 8.10] was observed among infants with severe redness and pus. Infections occurring after the third day of life were associated with subsequent risk of all-cause (OR: 3.11; 95\% CI: 1.68 \textendash 5.74) and sepsis-specific (OR: 4.63; 95\% CI: 2.15\textendash 9.96) mortality. Conclusions\textemdash This study provides evidence that common local signs of cord infection are associated with increased risk of mortality. Where exposure of the umbilical cord to potentially invasive pathogens is high, interventions to increase hygienic care of the cord should be promoted and including hand washing, avoiding harmful topical applications, and topical cord antisepsis.},

Methods We monitored illnesses, including diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARIs), school absences and soap consumption for 41 weeks in 70 low-income communities in Mumbai, India (35 communities per arm). Results Outcomes from 847 intervention households (containing 847 5-year-olds and 4863 subjects in total) and 833 control households (containing 833 5-year-olds and 4812 subjects) were modelled using negative binomial regression. Intervention group 5-year-olds had fewer episodes of diarrhoea (-25\%, 95\% confidence intervals [CI] = -37\%, -2\%), ARIs (-15\%, 95\% CI = -30\%, -8\%), school absences due to illnesses (-27\%, 95\% CI = -41\%, -18\%) and eye infections (-46\%, 95\% CI = -58\%, -31\%). Further, there were fewer episodes of diarrhoea and ARIs in the intervention group for `whole families' (-31\%, 95\% CI = -37\%, -5\%; and -14\%, 95\% CI = -23\%, -6\%, respectively), 6- to 15-year-olds (-30\%, 95\% CI = -39\%, -7\%; and -15\%, 95\% CI = -24\%, -6\%) and under 5 s (-32\%, 95\% CI = -41\%, -4\%; and -20\%, 95\% CI = -29\%, -8\%). Conclusions Direct-contact hand washing interventions aimed at younger school-aged children can affect the health of the whole family. These may be scalable through public\textendash private partnerships and classroom-based campaigns.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dedicated and motivated health workers (HWs) play a major role in delivering efficient and effective health services that improve patients' experience of health care. Growing interest in HW motivation has led to a global focus on pay for performance strategies, but less attention has been paid to nurturing intrinsic motivation. Workplace trust relationships involve fair treatment and respectful interactions between individuals. Such relationships enable cooperation among HWs and their colleagues, supervisors, managers and patients and may act as a source of intrinsic motivation. This paper presents findings from a qualitative systematic review of empirical studies providing evidence on HW motivation, to consider what these studies suggest about the possible influence of workplace trust relationships over motivation. METHODS: Five electronic databases were searched for articles reporting research findings about HW motivation for various cadres published in the 10-year period 2003 to 2013 and with available full free text in the English language. Data extraction involved consideration of the links between trust relationships and motivation, by identifying how studies directly or indirectly mention and discuss relevant factors. RESULTS: Twenty-three articles from low- and middle-income countries and eight from high-income countries that met predetermined quality and inclusion criteria were appraised and subjected to thematic synthesis. Workplace trust relationships with colleagues, supervisors and managers, employing organisation and patients directly and indirectly influence HW motivation. Motivational factors identified as linked to trust include respect; recognition, appreciation and rewards; supervision; teamwork; management support; autonomy; communication, feedback and openness; and staff shortages and resource inadequacy. CONCLUSION: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first systematic review on trust and motivation in the health sector. Evidence indicates that workplace trust relationships encourage social interactions and cooperation among HWs, have impact on the intrinsic motivation of HWs and have consequences for retention, performance and quality of care. Human resource management and organisational practices are critical in sustaining workplace trust and HW motivation. Research and assessment of the levels of motivation and factors that encourage workplace trust relationships should include how trust and motivation interact and operate for retention, performance and quality of care.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the Indian National Health Mission (NHM) was introduced by the Government of India as an umbrella of health programs to cover reproductive and child health, adolescent health, and selected disease control programs. These programs were given a mandate to accelerate the achievement of the health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. Considerable progress toward realizing the MDG objectives has been achieved, especially reductions in infant and child mortality and improvement in measles vaccination coverage (MDG Goal 4), as well as the reduction of maternal mortality and an increase in the number of births attended by skilled personnel (MDG Goal 5). Nevertheless, an overall appraisal of the status of the indicators in 2015 reveals that many of the targets remained to be achieved. The analytical issue explored here is whether the targets were too high to achieve or whether Indian health policies were flawed or too long delayed. This article offers a state-wise analysis of the achievements in health indicators relating to MDGs 4 and 5. The rate of achievement for two time periods, pre-NHM and NHM until 2015, is analyzed here. Our key finding is that most of the targets were indeed infeasible, but that lack of achievement could be attributed to delays in planning; sometimes poor execution of the policies and programs; and to the economic, social, and political disparities within the country. Better organized and more innovative approaches at the state level could improve the realization of vital MDG targets, providing improved public health for all.},

  abstract = {Objective To determine whether community-based health workers in a rural region of Ethiopia can provide injectable contraceptives to women with similar levels of safety, effectiveness and acceptability as health extension workers (HEWs). Methods This was a prospective non-randomized community intervention trial designed to test the provision of injectable contraceptives by community-based reproductive health agents (CBRHAs). Effectiveness, safety, acceptability and continuation rates were the outcomes of interest. The outcomes observed when injectable contraceptives were administered by HEWs in health posts and when they were administered by CBRHAs were compared by means of {$\chi$}2 tests for association among categorical variables and t-tests for independent samples to determine differences between group means. Findings A total of 1062 women participated in the study. Compared with health post clients, the clients of CBRHAs were, on average, slightly older, less likely to be married and less educated, and they had significantly more living children. Women seeking services from CBRHAs were also significantly more likely to be using injectable contraceptives for the first time; health post clients were more likely to have used them in the past. In addition, clients of CBRHAs were less likely to discontinue using injectable contraceptives over three injection cycles than health post clients. Conclusion Receiving injectable contraceptives from CBRHAs proved as safe and acceptable to this sample of Ethiopian women as receiving them in health posts from HEWs. These findings add to the growing body of evidence supporting the development, introduction and scale up of programmes to train community-based health workers such as CBRHAs to safely administer injectable contraceptives.},

RECENT FINDINGS: Forty-four studies are included in this review. Between 11 and 73.4\% of HCWs, mainly including physicians, nurses, and auxiliary staff, reported post-traumatic stress symptoms during outbreaks, with symptoms lasting after 1-3~years in 10-40\%. Depressive symptoms are reported in 27.5-50.7\%, insomnia symptoms in 34-36.1\%, and severe anxiety symptoms in 45\%. General psychiatric symptoms during outbreaks have a range comprised between 17.3 and 75.3\%; high levels of stress related to working are reported in 18.1 to 80.1\%. Several individual and work-related features can be considered risk or protective factors, such as personality characteristics, the level of exposure to affected patients, and organizational support. Empirical evidence underlines the need to address the detrimental effects of epidemic/pandemic outbreaks on HCWs' mental health. Recommendations should include the assessment and promotion of coping strategies and resilience, special attention to frontline HCWs, provision of adequate protective supplies, and organization of online support services.},

A subgroup analysis of the four studies in which at least 30\% of pregnant women participated in groups showed a 49\% reduction in maternal mortality (0{$\cdot$}51, 0{$\cdot$}29\textendash 0{$\cdot$}89) and a 33\% reduction in neonatal mortality (0{$\cdot$}67, 0{$\cdot$}60\textendash 0{$\cdot$}75).

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}p{$>$}We assessed progress for primary health care in countries since Alma-Ata. First we analysed life expectancy relative to national income and HIV prevalence to identify overachieving and underachieving countries. Then we focused on the 30 low-income and middle-income countries with the highest average yearly reduction of mortality among children less than 5 years of age, describing coverage and equity of primary health care as well as non-health sector actions. These 30 countries have scaled up selective primary health care (eg, immunisation, family planning), and 14 have progressed to comprehensive primary health care, marked by high coverage of skilled attendance at birth. Good governance and progress in non-health sectors are seen in almost all of the 14 countries identified with a comprehensive primary health care system. However, these 30 countries include those that are making progress despite very low income per person, political instability, and high HIV/AIDS prevalence. Thailand has the highest average yearly reduction in mortality among children less than 5 years of age (8{$\cdot$}5\%) and has achieved universal coverage of immunisation and skilled birth attendance, with low inequity. Lessons learned from all these countries include the need for a nationally agreed package of prioritised and phased primary health care that all stakeholders are committed to implementing, attention to district management systems, and consistent investment in primary health-care extension workers linked to the health system. More detailed analysis and evaluation within and across countries would be invaluable in guiding investments for primary health care, and expediting progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and "health for all".{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We present an overview of issues and evidence about the determinants of performance and strategies for improving it. Health-worker practices are complex behaviours that have many potential influences. Reviews of intervention studies in low and middle income countries suggest that the simple dissemination of written guidelines is often ineffective, that supervision and audit with feedback is generally effective, and that multifaceted interventions might be more effective than single interventions. Few interventions have been evaluated with rigorous cost-effectiveness trials, and such studies are urgently needed to guide policy. We propose an international collaborative research agenda to generate knowledge about the true determinants of performance and about the effectiveness of strategies to improve performance. Furthermore, we recommend that ministries of health and international organisations should actively help translate research findings into action to improve health-worker performance, and thereby improve health.},

The guiding questions were: What factors promote or undermine CHWs as accountability agents? (and) Can these factors be intentionally fostered or suppressed to impel health system accountability? We conducted an iterative search that included articles addressing the core issue of CHWs and accountability, and articles addressing ancillary issues that emerged in the initial search, such as 'CHWs and equity.'CHWs are intended to comprise a 'bridge' between community members and the formal health system. This bridge function is described in three key ways: service extender, cultural broker, social change agent. We identified several factors that shape the bridging function CHWs play, and thus, their role in fomenting health system accountability to communities, including the local political context, extent and nature of CHW interactions with other community-based structures, health system treatment of CHWs, community perceptions of CHWs, and extent and type of CHW unionisation and collectivisation.Synthesising these findings, we elaborated several analytic propositions relating to the self-reinforcing nature of the factors shaping CHWs' bridging function; the roles of local and national governance; and the human resource and material capacity of the health system. Importantly, community embeddedness, as defined by acceptability, social connections and expertise, is a crucial attribute of CHW ability to foment local government accountability to communities.},

Results supported the view that participants who formed implementation intentions were less likely to miss taking a pill every day compared to controls.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In India, with the introduction of Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers under the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) from 2005 to 2006, utilization of healthcare services at the peripheral level has improved. This study was conducted with the purpose of evaluating knowledge, attitudes and practices of ASHA workers in relation to child health. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at Palghar Taluka in the Thane district of Maharashtra for a period of 3 months from January 2011 to March 2011, inclusive, with the study participants all being trained ASHA workers working in the various primary health centres of Palghar Taluka. A total of 150 ASHA workers were working in the area, of which four workers were untrained and thus excluded from the study. The study was conducted by the authors after receiving permission from the medical officer in charge of the primary health centres. Each of the ASHA workers was then contacted individually by the authors and had the study explained to them, after which they were interviewed face to face. Informed consent was taken from each of the study participants. A pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire was designed for ASHA workers regarding child health after thoroughly studying the ASHA Training Module 2, which was then translated into their local language (ie Marathi). RESULTS: A total of 70 (47.9\%) workers were from the under 25 years age group; 67 (45.9\%) had received less than a secondary level education. A total of 67.1\% of ASHA workers were not aware of the correct preventive measures for vitamin A deficiency. Twenty-nine (19.9\%) of the ASHAs did not feel the need for referral for a child with diarrhoea who is unable to drink or breast feed. Similarly, in acute respiratory tract infections, 35 (23.9\%) of ASHAs did not know to refer a child with fast breathing. Fifty-nine ASHAs (50.4\%) considered a baby crying for more than 3 hours following immunization not worth referring to a first referral unit. The oral contraceptive pill was the most frequently advised temporary contraceptive measure for females in the reproductive age group (15-45 years). CONCLUSION: Despite the training given to ASHAs, lacunae still exists in their knowledge regarding various aspects of child health morbidity. Monthly meetings can be used as a platform for the reinforcement of various aspects of child health. Periodical refresher training should be conducted for all of the recruited ASHA workers. In the future training sessions, more emphasis should be given to high risk cases requiring prompt referral.},

  abstract = {Introduction:Community health workers (CHWs) play a key role in the health of mothers and newborns in low- and middle-income countries. However, it remains unclear by what actions and messages CHWs enable good outcomes and respectful care. Methods:We collected a uniquely linked set of questions on behaviors, beliefs, and care pathways from recently delivered women (n=5,469), their husbands (n=3,064), mothers-in-law (n=3,626), and CHWs (accredited social health activists; n=1,052) in Uttar Pradesh, India. We used logistic regression to study associations between CHW actions and household behaviors during antenatal, delivery, and postnatal periods. Results:Pregnant women who were visited earlier in pregnancy and who received multiple visits were more likely to perform recommended health behaviors including attending multiple checkups, consuming iron and folic acid tablets, and delivering in a health facility (ID), compared to women visited later or receiving fewer visits, respectively. Counseling the woman was associated with higher likelihood of attending 3+ checkups and consuming 100+ iron and folic acid tablets, whereas counseling the husband and mother-in-law was associated with higher rates of ID. Certain behavior change messages, such as the danger of complications, were associated with more checkups and ID, but were only used by 50\%\textendash 80\% of CHWs. During delivery, 57\% of women had the CHW present, and their presence was associated with respectful care, early initiation of breastfeeding, and exclusive breastfeeding, but not with delayed bathing or clean cord care. The newborn was less likely to receive delayed bathing if the CHW incorrectly believed that newborns could be bathed soon after birth (which is believed by 30\% of CHWs). CHW presence was associated with health behaviors more strongly for home than facility deliveries. Home visits after delivery were associated with higher rates of clean cord care and exclusive breastfeeding. Counseling the mother-in-law (but not the husband or woman) was associated with exclusive breastfeeding. Conclusion:We identified potential ways in which CHW impact could be improved, specifically by emphasizing the importance of home visits, which household members are targeted during these visits, and what messages are shared. Achieving this change will require training CHWs in counseling and behavior change and providing supervision and modern tools such as apps that can help the CHW keep track of her beneficiaries, suggest behavior change strategies, and direct attention to households that stand to gain the most from support.},

Data were collected to identify potential interventions that could be tested through a randomized control trial. Suggested interventions were organized into thematic areas; cross-cutting approaches, recruitment, training, supervision, incentives, community involvement and ownership, information and data management, and mHealth. The priority interventions of stakeholders correspond to key areas of the work motivation and CHW literature. Combined, they potentially provide useful insight for programmers engaging in further enquiry into the most locally relevant, acceptable, and evidence-based interventions.},

Further, significant literature illuminated the weakness of SBCC approaches that were primarily topdown and unidirectional and that failed to sufficiently include local actors. In SBCC for public health in areas such as child health and polio vaccination, the evidence is strong that community participatory approaches lead to better behavior outcomes. The literature also strongly supports the effectiveness of approaches that engage communities through interventions that are essentially dialogues; these approaches are more likely to reinforce or restore trust in system actors1 that represent the state. Trust in system actors is critical to achieving behavioral change and lack of trust in these actors thwarts SBCC efforts.},

  abstract = {Addressing health workforce shortage, maldistribution and performance challenges is essential for progress towards all health-related goals, including universal health coverage. Further, as evidenced by the recommendations of the United Nations High-Level Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth, there is increasing recognition of the potential of the health sector to create qualified employment opportunities, in particular for women, contributing to the job creation and economic development agenda. The education and deployment of interprofessional primary care teams of health workers should reflect a diverse and sustainable skills mix; in some contexts this may entail harnessing the potential of community health workers (CHWs) as part of broader efforts to strengthen primary health care and the health workforce more generally.},
